Chroma-Hash
===========

## A sexy, secure visualization of password field input

Chroma-Hash is a jQuery plugin that dynamically visualizes secure text-field values using ambient color bars

Password entry can be frustrating, especially with long or difficult passwords. On a webpage, secure fields obscure your input with •'s, so others can't read it. Unfortunately, neither can you—you can't tell if you got your password right until you click "Log In".

Chroma-Hash displays a series of colored bars at the end of field inputs so you can instantly see if your password is right. Chroma-Hash takes an MD5 hash of your input and uses that to compute the colors in the visualization. The resulting color pattern is non-reversible, so no one could know what your password just from the colors.

## Usage

    $("input:password").chromaHash({bars: 3, salt:"7be82b35cb0199120eea35a4507c9acf", minimum:6});

- `bars` : number of bars displayed (1,2,3, or 4)
- `salt` : value to be appended when calculating hash function
- `minimum` : minimum number of characters needed for grayscale bars to be displayed in color

## Requirements

- jQuery 1.3+

## Ports, Implementations, and Adaptations
